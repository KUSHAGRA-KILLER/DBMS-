            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Many public schools provide a free education through the government.
                Parents may send their own children to a private
                schools, but they must pay for it. In some poorer places, some children cannot go to school, because
                their countries do
                not make education available in their countries, or because their families do not have enough money, or
                because the
                children have to work for money, or because the society have negative prejudice on education for
                girls.The city of Alexandria in
                Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle of Ancient
                Greece. There, the
                great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd century BCE. European civilizations suffered a collapse
                of literacy and
                organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
                knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their
                society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed
                knowledge,
                values, and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond
                skills that could
                be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time
                of the Middle
                Kingdom.</p>
